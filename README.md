### Tool
We provide a jar file for testing our BRanch Of study Tool (Brot).
It can open [FeatureIDE][7] feature model files and allows creating configurations for them.
Opening the feature models of some branches may take a few minutes.
You can find the model files for the [branches of study at TU Braunschweig][6] in `Code/EclipseWorkspaces/Runtime/tubs.cs.branches_of_study/Studienrichtungen`.

Please note that opening them in the FeatureIDE plugins editor in eclipse may freeze the program because
some of the models are too large.

Examples for **using the SAT encodings in your own software projects** can be found in the [dedicated example project](https://github.com/SoftVarE-Group/BroTLibraryExample/tree/master).

### Code
The code is given in two [Eclipse][3] workspaces: `Runtime` and `Development`.

The [branches of study at TU Braunschweig][6] are given in the `Runtime` workspace together with
the feature models they were compiled to.
These are in german like the original specifications, but our DSL also supports english keywords.

The `Development` workspace contains the implementation of the at-most-k encodings, domain-specific language (DSL),
and compiler to feature models.
The encodings implementation can be found in the project `AtMostSATEncodings`.
Our DSL and compiler are in the project `tubs.cs.studienrichtung`, which is an Eclipse plugin project.
In order to run it, the [eclipse modelling framework][4] and [EMFText][5] are required.
The generated code for our abstract syntax is given in the `src-gen` subdirectory.
However, the concrete syntax has to be generated by running EMFText on our grammar file
`tubs.cs.studienrichtung\model\Studienrichtung.cs`. In Eclipse this can be done via the context menu.
The `GraphicalConfigurator` projects contains a simple configuration tool for feature models.
It can be used to configure the feature models, generated by our DSL compiler.

### Evaluation Data
We provide our data on evaluating the at-most-k encodings and feature models compiled from our DSL files, describing
the [branches of study at TU Braunschweig][6].
For each branch, csv files are given summarising the results for each encoding together with a general overview.
